## The Problem

Germany has over 5.7 million people in need of care, most of them living at home. They need help with everyday things like carrying groceries, setting up a router or mowing the lawn. But professional services are expensive and inflexible, and family isn't always nearby.

At the same time, millions of students want flexible income without fixed shifts or long-term contracts.

CuraConnect bridges this gap: a mobile-first marketplace where seniors post small tasks and verified student helpers apply.

## Business model

CuraConnect takes a 10% platform fee on each completed job. Additional revenue streams include Cura+ (€60/year subscription for priority matching) and local business advertising.

## Context

We developed CuraConnect, a Start-Up developed for **Jugend Gründet 2025/26**, a national entrepreneurship competition (~1,500 teams). The Start/Up placed **31st out of approximately 1,500 teams**.

This repository is my first prototype of the future website for CuraConnect, which I created using Google AI Studio. It combines traditional plattform features with AI implementations that make usage for Seniors easier.

## Team

This repository was built by Anton Zipperle as part of the CuraConnect team's entry for Jugend Gründet 2025/26 at Hebel-Gymnasium Schwetzingen.
